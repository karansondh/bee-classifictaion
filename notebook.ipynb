For example, <code>predict_proba</code> returns <code>[0.46195176, 0.53804824]</code> for the first image, meaning there is a 46% chance the bee in the image is an Apis (<code>0.0</code>) and a 53% chance the bee in the image is a Bombus (<code>1.0</code>).

However, this threshold can be adjusted. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic\">receiver operating characteristic curve</a> (ROC curve) plots the false positive rate and true positive rate at different thresholds.
